Raw data:
The given files are related as shown in ER.pdf and described in readme.txt
The generated tables have the same names as the original txt-files

The colname of subject_test and subject_train has been changed into "subject"
The colname of y_test and y_train has been changed into "activity_id

Combine x-test, subject_test and y_test to the table df_test with 2947 obs of 563 vars.
This table contains now the measurement data and its corresponding person-id and activity-id

Combine x-train, subject_train and y_train to the table df_train with 7352 obs of 563 vars to get the same information for the training data as we got before for the test data

Merge test and train data by adding rows to get one dataset df_test_train for test and training data with 10299 obs of 563 vars

get rows from features stored in f_names (chr 1:563) to rename colnames in dataframe df_test_train

add the colnames in f_names for the last two cols as "subject" and "activity_id"

change colnames in df_test_train from V.. into readable colnames with fnames

Extract colnames in f_names containing "mean()" or "std()" or "subject" or "activity_id"

Store the required cols with data in df_m_std with 10.299 of 81 vars

Merge the tables df_m_std and activity_labels to add the activities to the matching activity ids stored in table mean_std with 10.299 of 81 vars

Calculate average for each variable for each activity and each subject and store it in tidy_data_set
